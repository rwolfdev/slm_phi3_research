 ## Function Name: Addiere

### Description:
This function, `Addiere`, takes two integer parameters, `zahl1` and `zahl2`, and returns their sum as an integer. The purpose of this function is to perform a simple addition operation on two integer values.

### Parameters:
1. `zahl1` (int): The first integer value to be added.
2. `zahl2` (int): The second integer value to be added.

### Return Type:
The function returns an integer value, which is the sum of the two input parameters.

### Function Syntax:
```java
public int Addiere(int zahl1, int zahl2)
```

### Function Behavior:
The function adds the two input integer values, `zahl1` and `zahl2`, and returns the result.

### Example Usage:
```java
int result = Addiere(5, 10); // result will be 15
```

### Exception Handling:
This function does not throw any exceptions as it performs a simple arithmetic operation. However, it is assumed that the input parameters are valid integers.

### Notes:
- The function does not perform any type checking on the input parameters.
- The function does not handle overflow or underflow scenarios.
- The function does not have any side effects.
- The function does not modify the input parameters.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this function is O(1), as it performs a constant-time operation.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this function is O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount of space for the input parameters and the return value.ï¿½
