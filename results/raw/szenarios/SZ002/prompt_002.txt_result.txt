 ## Function: CountWords(string text)

### Description:
This function takes a string `text` as input and returns a `Dictionary<string, int>` containing the count of each unique word in the input text.

### Parameters:
1. `text` (string): The input string from which the word count will be calculated.

### Returns:
- `Dictionary<string, int>`: A dictionary where the key is a unique word from the input text and the value is the count of occurrences of that word.

### Functionality:
1. The input string is split into an array of words using the space character (' ') as the delimiter.
2. The words are then grouped by their unique values using the `GroupBy` method.
3. The grouped words are converted into a dictionary using the `ToDictionary` method, where the key is the word and the value is the count of occurrences of that word.

### Example:
```csharp
string inputText = "Hello world, hello everyone!";
Dictionary<string, int> wordCounts = CountWords(inputText);
// Output: { { "Hello", 2 }, { "world", 1 }, { "everyone", 1 } }
```

### Note:
This function does not consider case sensitivity or punctuation. If you need case-insensitive or punctuation-aware word counting, additional preprocessing may be required.ï¿½
