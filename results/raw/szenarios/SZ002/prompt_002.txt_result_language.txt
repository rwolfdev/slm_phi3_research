 ## Function: CountWords(string text)

### Overview:
This function takes a string `text` as input and returns a `Dictionary<string, int>`, where each key represents a unique word from the input text and its corresponding value represents the frequency of that word in the text.

### Parameters:
1. `text` (string): The input string from which the word count will be calculated.

### Return Type:
- `Dictionary<string, int>`: A dictionary containing the unique words from the input text as keys and their respective frequencies as values.

### Functionality:
1. The input string `text` is split into an array of words using the space character (' ') as the delimiter.
2. The resulting array of words is then grouped by their unique values using the `GroupBy` method.
3. The grouped words are converted into a dictionary using the `ToDictionary` method, where each key is the word and its value is the count of occurrences of that word in the input text.

### Example:
```csharp
string inputText = "Hello world, this is a test. Hello again!";
Dictionary<string, int> wordCounts = CountWords(inputText);
// Output: { { "Hello", 2 }, { "world,", 1 }, { "this", 1 }, { "is", 1 }, { "a", 1 }, { "test.", 1 }, { "again!", 1 } }
```

### Note:
- The function does not consider punctuation marks as part of the words.
- The function is case-sensitive, meaning "Hello" and "hello" will be treated as two different words.
- The function does not handle empty strings or null inputs.ï¿½
