 ## Function: CountWords(string text)

### Purpose:
This function counts the occurrences of each word in a given string and returns a dictionary mapping words to their respective counts.

### Input Parameters:
1. `text` (string): The input string from which word counts will be determined.

### Return Value:
- Type: `Dictionary<string, int>`
- Description: A dictionary where each key represents a unique word from the input string, and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that word.

### Function Details:
```csharp
public Dictionary<string, int> CountWords(string text)
{
    // Split the input text into words based on space delimiter
    var words = text.Split(' ');

    // Group words and count occurrences
    var wordCounts = words.GroupBy(w => w)
                         .ToDictionary(g => g.Key, g => g.Count());

    return wordCountin
}
```

### Key Notes/Limitations:
- The function assumes that words are separated by a single space character.
- It does not handle punctuation or case sensitivity; "Word" and "word" would be considered different words.
- The function does not remove common stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "at") from the count.
- The dictionary may contain null or empty keys if the input string contains consecutive spaces or no words at all.ï¿½
