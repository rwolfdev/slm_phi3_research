 ## Function Name: FilterEvenNumbers

### Description:
This function, `FilterEvenNumbers`, takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array containing only the even numbers from the input array. The function uses LINQ's `Where` method to filter the even numbers and `ToArray` method to convert the resulting `IEnumerable<int>` into an array.

### Parameters:
1. `numbers` (array of integers): The input array of integers from which even numbers will be filtered.

### Return Value:
- An array of integers (`int[]`) containing only the even numbers from the input array.

### Exceptions:
- No exceptions are thrown by this function.

### Function Syntax:
```csharp
public int[] FilterEvenNumbers(int[] numbers)
{
    return numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0).ToArray();
}
```

### Function Details:
- The function uses LINQ's `Where` method to filter the input array and select only the even numbers.
- The `n % 2 == 0` condition checks if a number is even.
- The `ToArray` method is used to convert the resulting `IEnumerable<int>` into an array.

### Example Usage:
```csharp
int[] inputNumbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
int[] evenNumbers = FilterEvenNumbers(inputNumbers);

// evenNumbers will contain {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
```

### Notes:
- The function assumes that the input array is not null.
- The function does not modify the input array.
- The function does not handle the case where the input array is empty. In such cases, the returned array will also be empty.ï¿½
