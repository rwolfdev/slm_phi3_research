 ## Function: FilterEvenNumbers(int[])

### Purpose:
This function filters and returns an array containing only the even numbers from the input array.

### Input:
- `numbers` (int[]): An array of integers to be filtered for even numbers.

### Output:
- `result` (int[]): An array containing only the even numbers from the input array.

### Description:
The `FilterEvenNumbers` function takes an array of integers as input and uses LINQ's `Where` method to filter out the even numbers. It then converts the filtered sequence into an array using `ToArray` and returns this new array.

### Syntax:
```csharp
public int[] FilterEvenNumbers(int[] numbers)
{
    return numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0).ToArray();
}
```

### Key Notes/Limitations:
- The function assumes that the input array is not null.
- The function does not modify the original input array.
- The returned array will contain the even numbers in the same order as they appear in the input array.
- The function does not handle cases where the input array is empty or contains no even numbers. In such cases, an empty array will be returned.ï¿½
