 # Patient Class Documentation

## Overview

The `Patient` class represents a patient's information, including their first name, last name, date of birth, and insurance number. It provides methods to calculate the patient's age and update their insurance number.

## Properties

### `_id`

A private read-only `Guid` field that uniquely identifies the patient.

### `FirstName`

A public read-only property that returns the patient's first name.

### `LastName`

A public read-only property that returns the patient's last name.

### `DateOfBirth`

A public read-only property that returns the patient's date of birth.

### `InsuranceNumber`

A public property with a private setter that returns the patient's insurance number. The setter is only accessible within the class.

## Constructor

The `Patient` class has a single constructor that takes the patient's first name, last name, date of birth, and insurance number as parameters. It generates a unique `Guid` for `_id` and assigns the provided values to the corresponding properties.

## Methods

### `GetAge()`

A public method that calculates and returns the patient's age based on their date of birth and the current date.

### `UpdateInsurance(string newInsuranceNumber)`

A public method that updates the patient's insurance number with the provided `newInsuranceNumber`.

### `ToString()`

A public method that returns a string representation of the patient' elements.

## Example Usage

```csharp
Patient patient = new Patient("John", "Doe", new DateTime(1990, 1, 1), "1234567890");
int age = patient.GetAge();
Console.WriteLine($"Patient: {patient}");
Console.WriteLine($"Age: {age}");

patient.UpdateInsurance("0987654321");
Console.WriteLine($"Updated Insurance Number: {patient.InsuranceNumber}");
```

This example creates a new `Patient` object, calculates and prints the patient's age, and updates the patient's insurance number.ï¿½
