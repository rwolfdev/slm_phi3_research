 # Patient Class Documentation

## Overview

The `Patient` class represents a patient's information, including their first name, last name, date of birth, and insurance number. It also provides methods to calculate the patient's age and update their insurance number.

## Properties

### `_id`

A private read-only `Guid` field that uniquely identifies the patient.

### `FirstName`

A public read-only property that returns the patient's first name.

### `LastName`

A public read-only property that returns the patient's last name.

### `DateOfBirth`

A public read-only property that returns the patient's date of birth.

### `InsuranceNumber`

A public read-only property that returns the patient's insurance number. The setter is private, meaning it can only be modified within the class.

## Constructor

The `Patient` class has a single constructor that takes the patient's first name, last name, date of birth, and insurance number as parameters. It generates a unique `_id` using `Guid.NewGuid()` and assigns the provided values to the respective properties.

## Methods

### `GetAge()`

A public method that calculates and returns the patient's age based on their date of birth and the current date.

### `UpdateInsurance(string newInsuranceNumber)`

A public method that updates the patient's insurance number with the provided `newInsuranceNumber`.

### `ToString()`

A public method that returns a string representation of the patient's information in the format: "{FirstName} {LastName} ({DateOfBirth:yyyy-MM-dd})".

## Example Usage

Patient patient = new Patient("John", "Doe", new DateTime(1990, 1, 1), "1234567890");
Console.WriteLine(patient.ToString()); // Output: John Doe (1990-01-01)
Console.WriteLine(patient.GetAge()); // Output: 31
patient.UpdateInsurance("0987654321");
