 # FinancialDataHub Class Documentation

## Overview

The `FinancialDataHub` class is a part of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR` namespace and is designed to facilitate real-time financial data updates and price information retrieval in a financial data hub application. This class extends the `Hub` class provided by SignalR, enabling it to broadcast messages to clients and manage connections.

## Class Members

### Private Fields

- `_latestPrices`: A `ConcurrentDictionary<string, decimal>` that stores the latest price information for various financial symbols. This dictionary is thread-safe and allows concurrent access to the data.

### Public Methods

#### `SendPriceUpdate(string symbol, decimal price)`

This asynchronous method is responsible for updating the latest price of a financial symbol and broadcasting the update to all connected clients.

- Parameters:
  - `symbol`: A string representing the financial symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc.).
  - `price`: A decimal value representing the latest price of the financial symbol.

- Returns:
  - None.

#### `GetLastKnownPrice(string symbol)`

This method retrieves the last known price of a financial symbol from the `_latestPrices` dictionary. If the symbol is not found, it returns `null`.

- Parameters:
  - `symbol`: A string representing the financial symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc.).

- Returns:
  - A `decimal?` value representing the last known price of the financial symbol, or `null` if the symbol is not found.

#### `OnConnectedAsync()`

This asynchronous method is called when a client connects to the SignalR hub. It sends a "ConnectionEstablished" message to the client that initiated the connection, and then calls the base `OnConnectedAsync()` method to handle any additional connection-related tasks.

- Parameters:
  - None.

#### `OnDisconnectedAsync(Exception? exception)`

This asynchronous method is called when a client disconnects from the SignalR hub. It sends a "UserDisconnected" message to all connected clients and then calls the base `OnDisconnectedAsync()` method to handle any additional disconnection-related tasks.

- Parameters:
  - `exception`: An optional `Exception` object representing the reason for the client's disconnection.

## Usage

To use the `FinancialDataHub` class, you can create an instance of the class and call its methods as needed. For example, to update the latest price of a financial symbol and broadcast the update to all connected clients, you can call the `SendPriceUpdate` method:

```csharp
var financialDataHub = new FinancialDataHub();
financialDataHub.SendPriceUpdate("AAPL", 150.00m);
```

To retrieve the last known price of a financial symbol, you can call the `GetLastKnownPrice` method:

```csharp
var lastKnownPrice = financialDataHub.GetLastKnownPrice("AAPL");
```

## Conclusion

The `FinancialDataHub` class provides a foundation for building a financial data hub application using SignalR. It allows for real-time updates and retrieval of financial data, making it an essential component for financial data hubs and applications.ï¿½
