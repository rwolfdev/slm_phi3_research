    - **Parameters**: None.
    - **Returns**: `Task`

4. `OnDisconnectedAsync(Exception? exception)`
    - **Purpose**: Overrides the base `OnDisconnectedAsync` method to send a "UserDisconnected" message to all connected clients and handle any exceptions that may occur during disconnection.

## Summary

The `FinancialDataHub` class is a SignalR hub that provides real-time financial data updates and price information retrieval. It uses a `ConcurrentDictionary` to store and manage the latest price data for various financial symbols, and it communicates with connected clients through the `SendPriceUpdate` and `GetLastKnownPrice` methods. The `OnConnectedAsync` and `OnDisconnectedAsync` methods handle client connection and disconnection events, respectively.ï¿½
