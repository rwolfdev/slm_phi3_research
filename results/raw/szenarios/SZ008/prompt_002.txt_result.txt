 Project: FOPService

Overview:
The FOPService project is a Spring Boot application that provides PDF generation functionality using Apache FOP. It includes two endpoints: one for accepting multipart/form-data with file uploads (XML and XSL) and another for accepting raw string parts (XML and XSL).

Key Components:
1. FopServiceApplication.java: The main class of the project, annotated with @SpringBootApplication. It contains the main method to run the Spring Boot application.
2. PdfController.java: A REST controller that handles PDF generation requests. It has two endpoints: "/render/files" and "/render/strings".
3. application.properties: A Spring Boot application properties file that sets the application name.
4. FopServiceApplicationTests.java: A JUnit test class for testing the Spring Boot application context.

Key Functions:
1. FopServiceApplication: The main class that runs the Spring Boot application.
2. PdfController: A REST controller that handles PDF generation requests.
3. generatePdf: An internal method that transforms XML and XSL into a PDF using Apache FOP.

Key Features:
1. PDF generation using Apache FOP.
2. Two endpoints for PDF generation: one accepting multipart/form-data with file uploads, and another accepting raw string parts.
3. Spring Boot and Spring MVC integration for handling HTTP requests and responses.
4. Spring Boot application properties configuration.

Key Dependencies:
1. Spring Boot
2. Spring MVC
3. Apache FOP
4. JUnit
5. Apache Commons IO

Key Functions:

2. PdfController: A REST controller that handles PDF generation requests.
3. generatePdf: An internal method that transforms XML and XSL into a PDF using Apache FOP.

Key Tests:
1. FopServiceApplicationTests: A JUnit test class for testing the Spring Boot application context.

Key Configuration:
1. application.properties: A Spring Boot application properties file that sets the application name.

Key Endpoints:
