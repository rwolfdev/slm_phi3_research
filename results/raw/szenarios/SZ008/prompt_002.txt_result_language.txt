 Project: FOPService

Overview:
The FOPService project is a Spring Boot application that provides an API for generating PDF documents using Apache FOP and XSLT transformations. The project includes two main components: FopServiceApplication and PdfController.

FopServiceApplication:
This class serves as the entry point for the Spring Boot application. It is annotated with @SpringBootApplication, which enables auto-configuration and component scanning. The main method runs the SpringApplication.run() method, which starts the Spring Boot application.

PdfController:
This controller class is responsible for handling PDF generation requests. It contains two endpoints:

1. Endpoint 1: Accepts multipart/form-data with file uploads (XML and XSL). The method renderFromFiles() takes MultipartFile objects for XML and XSL files and generates a PDF document using Apache FOP and XSLT transformations.

2. Endpoint 2: Accepts multipart/form-data with raw string parts (XML and XSL). The method renderFromStrings() takes XML and XSL strings as input and generates a PDF document using Apache FOP and XSLT transformations.

generatePdf() method:
This internal method is responsible for the actual PDF generation process. It performs two steps:

1. Transform XML + XSL into XSL-FO using Apache FOP.
2. Transform XSL-FO into PDF using Apache FOP.

The project also includes a test class, FopServiceApplicationTests, which tests the SpringBootTest annotation and ensures that the application context loads correctly.

Properties file:
The application.properties file contains the Spring Boot application name configuration.

Overall, the FOPService project provides an API for generating PDF documents using Apache FOP and XSLT transformations, with support for both file uploads and raw string inputs.ï¿½
