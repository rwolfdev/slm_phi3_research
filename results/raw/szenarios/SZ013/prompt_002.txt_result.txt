 # AnalyzeTransactions Function Documentation

## Overview

The `AnalyzeTransactions` function analyzes a list of `Transaction` objects and categorizes them into various groups based on their amount, date, and category. The function returns a `Dictionary<string, decimal>` containing the total amounts for each category.

## Parameters

1. `transactions`: A list of `Transaction` objects.

## Return Value

A `Dictionary<string, decimal>` containing the total amounts for each category.

## Function Details

The function iterates through each transaction in the input list and performs the following checks:

1. Determines if the transaction is suspicious based on the amount and category.
2. Determines if the transaction is recurring and categorizes it as small, normal, or large recurring.
3. Determines if the transaction is high-value and categorizes it as investment, luxury, or other high-value.
