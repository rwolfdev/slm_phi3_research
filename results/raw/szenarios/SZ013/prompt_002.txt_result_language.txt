 # AnalyzeTransactions Function Documentation

## Overview

The `AnalyzeTransactions` function analyzes a list of `Transaction` objects and categorizes them into various groups based on their amount, date, and category. The function returns a `Dictionary<string, decimal>` containing the total amounts for each category.

## Parameters

1. `transactions`: A list of `Transaction` objects.

## Return Value

A `Dictionary<string, decimal>` containing the total amounts for each category.

## Functionality

1. Initialize a dictionary with keys "Suspicious", "Recurring", "HighValue", "Weekend", and "Total" with initial values of 0.
2. Initialize variables `suspiciousTotal`, `recurringTotal`, `highValueTotal`, and `weekendTotal` to 0.
3. Iterate through each transaction in the input list.
4. Determine if the transaction is suspicious, recurring, high-value, or falls on a weekend.
5. Update the appropriate dictionary key with the transaction amount.
6. Return the dictionary containing the total amounts for each category.

## Key Categories

- **Suspicious**: Transactions with amounts greater than 5000m and either category "Cash" or "Online" on a weekend.
- **Recurring**: Transactions with amounts less than 50m and not suspicious, categorized as "SmallRecurring", "NormalRecurring", or "LargeRecurring" based on the amount.
- **HighValue**: Transactions with amounts greater than 10000m, categorized as "InvestmentHighValue", "LuxuryHighValue", or "OtherHighValue" based on the category.
- **Weekend**: Transactions with dates falling on a Saturday or Sunday, categorized as "WeekendFood" or "WeekendTravel" based on the category.

## Example
