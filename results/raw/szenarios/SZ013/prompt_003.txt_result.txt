 # AnalyzeTransactions Method Documentation

## Purpose
Analyzes a list of `Transaction` objects and categorizes them into various totals based on suspicious, recurring, high-value, and weekend transactions. The method returns a `Dictionary<string, decimal>` containing the aggregated amounts for each category.

## Parameters
- `transactions`: A list of `Transaction` objects to be analyzed.

## Return Value
- `Dictionary<string, decimal>`: A dictionary containing the aggregated amounts for each category.

## Input Parameters
- `transactions` (List<Transaction>): A list of `Transaction` objects.

## Key Notes/Limitations
- The method assumes that the `Transaction` class has the following properties:
  - `Date` (DateTime): The date of the transaction.
  - `Amount` (decimal): The monetary value of the transaction.
  - `Category` (string): The category of the transaction (e.g., "Cash", "Gift", "Online", "Investment", "Luxury", "Food", "Travel").
  - `IsRecurring` (bool): Indicates if the transaction is recurring.
  - `IsWeekend` (bool): Indicates if the transaction occurred on a weekend.
