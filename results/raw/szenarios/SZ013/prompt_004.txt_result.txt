 # AnalyzeTransactions Method Documentation

## Purpose
Analyzes a list of `Transaction` objects to categorize transactions into suspicious, recurring, high-value, and weekend transactions, and calculates their respective totals. The results are returned as a `Dictionary<string, decimal>`.

## Parameters
- `transactions`: A list of `Transaction` objects to be analyzed.

## Return Value
- `Dictionary<string, decimal>`: A dictionary containing the categorized transactions and their respective totals.

## Key Notes/Limitations
- The method assumes that the `Transaction` class has the following properties: `Date`, `Amount`, `Category`, `IsRecurring`, and `IsWeekend`.
- The categorization logic is based on predefined criteria for suspicious, recurring, high-value, and weekend transactions. Adjustments may be needed based on specific business rules.
- The method does not handle potential exceptions that may occur during the execution.

## Method Signature
```csharp
public Dictionary<string, decimal> AnalyzeTransactions(List<Transaction> transactions)
{
    Dictionary<string, decimal> result = new Dictionary<string, decimal>();
    decimal suspiciousTotal = 0;
    decimal recurringTotal =

# AnalyzeTransactions Method Documentation

## Purpose
The `AnalyzeTransactions` method processes a list of `Transaction` objects to categorize and sum transactions based on suspicious, recurring, high-value, and weekend criteria. The results are returned as a dictionary mapping categories to their respective total amounts.

## Parameters
- `transactions`: A list of `Transaction` objects to be analyzed.

## Return Value
- `Dictionary<string, decimal>`: A dictionary where each key represents a transaction category (e.g., "Suspicious", "Recurring", "HighValue", "Weekend") and the corresponding value is the total amount of transactions in that category.

## Key Notes/Limitations
- The method assumes the existence of a `Transaction` class with properties: `Date`, `Amount`, `Category`, `IsRecurring`, and `IsWeekend`.
- The categorization logic is based on predefined criteria for each category. Adjustments may be necessary to align with specific business rules.
- The method does not handle potential exceptions that may occur during execution.
- The method does not account for transactions that may fall into multiple categories.
