 # AnalyzeTransactions Method Documentation

## Purpose
Analyzes a list of `Transaction` objects to categorize transactions into suspicious, recurring, high-value, and weekend transactions, and calculates their respective totals. The results are stored in a `Dictionary<string, decimal>`.

## Parameters

### Input:
- `transactions`: A list of `Transaction` objects to be analyzed.

### Output:
- `Dictionary<string, decimal>`: A dictionary containing the categorized totals and individual transaction amounts.

## Key Notes/Limitations
- The method assumes that the `Transaction` class has the following properties:
  - `Date` (DateTime): The date of the transaction.
  - `Amount` (decimal): The monetary value of the transaction.
  - `Category` (string): The category of the transaction (e.g., "Cash", "Gift", "Online", "Investment", "Luxury").
  - `IsRecurring` (bool): Indicates if the transaction is recurring.
  - `IsWeekend` (bool): Indicates if the transaction occurred on a weekend.
  - `IsSuspicious` (bool): Indicates if the transaction is considered suspicious based on the amount and category.

- The method does not handle transactions with null or invalid values.
- The categorization and totals are based on predefined conditions and may not cover all possible transaction scenarios.

## Method Signature
```csharp
public Dictionary<string, decimal> AnalyzeTransactions(List<Transaction> transactions)
```

## Method Description
The `AnalyzeTransactions` method iterates over a list of `Transaction` objects, categorizes transactions based on their amount and properties, and calculates the total amounts for each category. The results are stored in a dictionary with keys representing the category and values representing the total amount for that category. The method also calculates and returns the total amounts for suspicious, recurring, high-value, and weekend transactions separately.ï¿½
