 # ValidateForm Method Documentation

## Purpose
Validates a form's input fields based on specified criteria and returns a dictionary of errors.

## Parameters
- `inputs`: A list of `FieldInput` objects representing the form's input fields.

### FieldInput
- `Name`: A string representing the name of the input field.
- `Type`: An enumeration representing the type of the input field (e.g., Text, Number, Date, Email, Password).
- `Value`: A string representing the value entered in the input field.
- `Required`: A boolean indicating whether the field is required.
- `Priority`: An integer representing the priority of the field (higher values indicate higher priority).

## Return Value
A dictionary with string keys and string values, where each key represents the name of an input field and the corresponding value is an error message if applicable.

## Key Notes and Limitations
- Critical errors in high-priority fields trigger a form rejection.
- Password validation checks for the presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- The method does not handle validation for all possible input types and may require additional logic for other types.
- The method assumes that the `Priority` property is an integer and that higher values indicate higher priority.
- The method does not handle validation for fields with a priority of 5 or higher.
